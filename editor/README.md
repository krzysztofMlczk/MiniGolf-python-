Little manual for the map editor:

from templates directory and you can select each one of them by left-clicking on its icon.
The name of currently selected object should appear in the corner.

PLACING AND REMOVING OBJECTS:
If you selected an object from the toolbox, you can now left-click on a tile of the map grid to place this
object there.
If you want to remove existing object from the tile, simply right-click on it.
